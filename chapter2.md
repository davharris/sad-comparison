##Data
Data were downloaded from the Relative Abundance Database (RAD database) <!-- available through website --> The RAD database is a summarized form of the data, and contains species richness and abundance for each site, as well as additional variables of interest.  I obtained the raw data on request from Marcin Ollik and Werner Ulrich.

<!-- I used raw data, paper used S and N from the RAD database to fit models. -->



##Models
<!-- I used five models, they used three -->
<!--Continuous vs. discrete-->

##Analysis
<!-- I used maximum likelihood methods to fit the data, paper used Fortran code available through website. -->

#Results
I found that the logseries won, instead of the Poisson lognormal, which they found won.
