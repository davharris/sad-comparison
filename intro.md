The hollow curve species abundance distribution is one of the most ubiquitous patterns in nature, and many models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms that generate this pattern.  While there have been numerous comparisons of species abundance distribution models, few have tested more than two models against each other.  I compiled data from the literature to fill gaps in available data for underrepresented taxonomic groups, and combined this with other macroecological datasets to perform two tests of the species abundance distribution, a multiple model comparison, and a targeted comparison of neutral theory against a non-neutral model of species abundance.

#Introduction
<!--Overarching introduction that ties all three chapters together -->
Macroecology is a data-intensive approach to studying ecological patterns and processes. As the field has matured, increasingly greater amounts of data have become available to address these questions [@reichman2011].  Although the macroecological research program has matured a great deal since its introduction [@mcgill2010mechanisms; @keith2012macroecology], there have been some recent critiques of the macroecological approach, both rejections of the macroecological approach [@paine2010macroecology], as well as directions for improvement [@beck2012].  One of the major criticisms of macroecology is the traditonal North American terrestrial focus [@beck2012], a legacy of the academic heritage of the scientists who developed macroecology, as well as the availablity of large ecological datasets suitable for testing macroecological questions.  Another major criticism has been the focus on pattern description, but a lack of identification of pattern generating mechanisms [@beck2012].

A set of best practices for testing patterns and theory with macroecological techniques have been developed as the discipline has matured [@clark1999; @mcgill2007; @white2008; @burnham2002].  
Some of these best practices for testing macroecological theory include: <!--citations-->  

* Testing the generality of patterns with multiple taxonomic groups/ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic/marine. 
* Simultaneous testing of models and model predictions with a consistent statistical approach.  

Following these best practices allows for a more rigorous assessment of the generality of patterns across taxonomic groups/ecosystems, and may provide better insight into identifying pattern generating mechanisms and improve the ability to make ecological predictions based on these general patterns. Here we address these two criticisms of the macroecological research program by presenting a unique dataset for addressing macroecological questions and demonstrate how the data can be applied, in combination with additional data, to address questions involving one of the most ubiquitious macroecological patterns, the hollow curve species abundance distribution. 


First, to address some of the concerns about the lack of data for underrepresented taxonomic groups and ecosystems, I compiled a set of data from the literature.  My primary focus for data collection was to collect data for those vertebrate taxa which are not already well represented by publicly available data.  I selected these taxa, because their taxonomy is fairly well resolved when compared to invertebrate groups.  While my primary focus was on fish, reptiles, and amphibians, I also compiled data on spiders and beetles.  In addition, I also collected a small amount of bird data, which could potentially be used in comparision with the large, publicly available bird datasets to determine if the dataset affects the results.

Second,  we compete five models from each of four different model families: purely statistical, branching process, population dynamics, and niche partitioning [@mcgill2007] with community abundance data from the database described in this dissertation for reptiles, amphibians, bony fish, beetles, and spiders and add to this data from birds, trees, mammals, and butterflies to perform the largest test of species abundance distributions to date.  We follow the current best practice recommendations for testing species abundance distribution models to determine which models provide the best fit to empirical data.  Identifying which, if any, models best describe the data can help determine what pattern generating mechanisms are more likely to have direct influences on the shape of the species abundance distribution.

Third, we expand our exploration of the hollow curve species abundance distribution using the same data used in the previous objective to build off work by Connolly et al. 2014 in marine systems to determine if species abundance data is sufficient for identifying neutral vs. non-neutral processes [@connolly2014].  Connolly et al found that the majority of sites were best described by a non-neutral model of species abundance in marine ecosystems; however, this has not yet been tested for terrestrial systems.  This work seeks to determine the generality of the non-neutral species abundance distribution method in terrestrial systems, and identify whether there are differences between terrestrial and marine systems relative to species abundance distributions.
