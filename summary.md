#Summary and conclusions

It is difficult to infer process from species abundance distributions alone.  Part of the difficulty in distinguishing process from species abundance distribution is due to the multiple mechanisms that have been proposed for each formulation of the species abundance distribution.  Subsuming some of these differences into broad categories such as neutral or non-neutral (sensu Connolly 2014) may be a more productive approach to narrowing the field of possibility, but there may not be one single suite of processes that have equal importance in all communities, i.e., non-neutral processes may be more important in some communities, but not in others.

Another potentially confounding factor when trying to identify pattern generating mechanisms is non-biological differences (sampling intensity, etc.) vs. biological differences.  Using data from different taxonomic groups and from different geographic regions assists in removing some of the uncertainty relating to non-biological data differences through covering a range of sampling intensities and scales of collection.   This suggests that we may be able to identify differences between marine vs. terrestrial that we might not otherwise have been able to distinguish.


A traditional hierarchy of scientific research is to identify general patterns, then pattern generating mechanisms (process), then use those processes to generate predictions.  While this has been the traditional approach, pattern to process to prediction, identification of process may not be neccesary for prediction.  It may be possible to generate robust ecological predictions from general patterns without specific knowledge of the pattern generating mechanisms [@frank2009, @frank2014, @locey2013]  Process and prediction may be two separate research goals [@mcgill2010mechanisms].

One criticism of the macroecological approach is that it attempts to replace natural history and field experimentation with entirely computational and observational approaches to experimentation. The increasing amount of data and computational power creates new opportunities to address major ecological questions in a new way. However, while computational techniques and large datasets are a powerful tool for ecology, they are not a panacea. Rather, the macroecological research program addresses different questions from a different perspective than those of traditional ecology, and thus both approaches are vital to continue in the search for pattern generating mechanisms in ecology.
