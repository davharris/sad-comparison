#Introduction
<!-- Connolly et al 2014. -->
Neutral theory is a big important theory

Can check for neutrality using abundance distribution data

Works for marine systems, does it work with more data, both terrestrial and marine.

Descriptions of datasets
For this analysis, we used the data from White et al 2012 [@white2012], as well as the data described in chapter 2 of this dissertation.  These data cover 9 distinct taxonomic groups and include birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, bony fish, beetles, spiders, butterflies, and trees from 16,218 distinct communities over all major biogeographic regions.  The majority of the data are publicly available and were accessed through the EcoData Retriever [@morris2013] (US Geological Survey's North American Breeding Bird Survey [BBS; @pardieck2014], Mammal Community Database [MCDB; @thibault2011], US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis [FIA; @fia], Gentry's Forest Transect Data Set [Gentry; @phillips2002]). The North American Butterfly Association count data [NABC; @naba] and the Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count [CBC; @cbc] are not publicly available and were obtained through Memorandums of Understanding with the respective organizations.
