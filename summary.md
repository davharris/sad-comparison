It is difficult to infer process from species abundance distributions alone.

May not be one single suite of processes that have equal importance in all communities, i.e., non-neutral processes may be more important in some communities, but not in others.

A traditional hierarchy of scientific research is to identify general patterns, then pattern generating mechanisms (process), then use those processes to generate predictions.  While this has been the traditional approach, pattern to process to prediction, identification of process may not be neccesary for prediction.  It may be possible to generate robust ecological predictions from general patterns without specific knowledge of the pattern generating mechanisms [@frank2009, @frank2014, @locey2013]  Process and prediction may be two separate research goals [@mcgill2010mechanisms].

The increasing amount of data and computational power creates new opportunities to address major ecological questions in a new way. However, while computational techniques and large datasets are a powerful tool for ecology, they are not a panacea.  One criticism of the macroecological approach is that it attempts to substitute for natural history and field experimentation.  Rather, the macroecological research program addresses different questions, from a different perspective than those of traditional ecology, and thus both approaches are vital to continue in the search for pattern generating mechanisms in ecology.
