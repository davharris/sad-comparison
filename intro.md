#Introduction
<!--Overarching introduction that ties all three chapters together -->
Macroecology is a data-driven approach to answering ecological questions.  

There are some criticisms of macroecology, one of which is the terrestrial focus, also lots of birds and North America
<!-- cite some of the recent critiques and directional papers -->

In response to, as the discipline has matured, a set of best practices for testing patterns and theory with macroecological techniques have been developed.

Best practices for testing macroecological theory <!--citations-->
Multiple taxonomic groups
Multiple ecosystems
Multiple patterns

I used best practices and a bunch of data to test species abundance distribution.
I compiled a set of data from the literature to address some of the concerns about the lack of data for certain taxonomic groups.
Data filling in gaps, data, data, data.


Questions answered with the data 
Two major focuses in ecology in general, and macroecology in particular are pattern and process.  In chapter 1, I demonstrated something about how more data are better by competing several forms of the species abundance distribution something about can't remember, got interrupted.  In chapter 3, I used the data I compiled to additional test something about process and neutral theory.
