#Chapter 2

#Abstract
<!--  Number of taxa, number of communities -->

#Background & Summary
<!-- Background and summary for collecting the data.  Publicly available community datasets suitable for macroecological research mostly birds, trees, mammals, North American focus.  Other taxa also good, compilation with abundances for greater comparisonability across taxa -->

#Methods
<!-- How data were collected, verified, metadata-->
Data Sources:

Data were compiled from the scientific literature.  References for data sources are presented in a separate file, citations_table_abundances.csv, because of the extensive reference list involved with this project. 

 

     Data Collection

Data were hand entered into a raw data file as they came from the original source or extracted from the original source computationally.  All the data initially collected were not included in the final summary, because they were not deemed suitable for inclusion in the final database.

The data have not been updated taxonomically; the species names were kept as given in the original source.  

 

     Variables:

Abundance: total number of individuals captured

Relative_abundance: total number of individuals captured for a single species/ total number of individuals of all species.

#Data Records
The data are presented here in the following files: 
 
Abundance data: Species_abundances.csv

Reference file: Citations_table_abundances.csv

Sites data file : Sites_table_abundances.csv
    

#Technical Validation
<!--Validation and figures (breakdown of data by taxa, etc.)-->
Data have undergone initial quality and assurance checking.  Data were entered directly from the source material into the raw data file and values were double checked on entry.
