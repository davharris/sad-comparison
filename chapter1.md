# Introduction
Very important first sentence.
###Proliferation of SAD models, no agreement about winners. (citations galore)
A fundamental and ubiquitous ecological pattern is the presence of many rare species and few super abundant species within a community, forming a hollow curve distribution.  Because of the generality of this pattern, the species abundance distribution (SAD) has been one of the most widely studied patterns in ecology, leading to a proliferation of models that attempt to characterize the shape of the distribution and identify potential mechanisms for the pattern. The most recent comprehensive review and classification of species abundance distributions was given by McGill et al. 2007.




###Statistical descriptions of SAD distributions, vs. process based.
### Set up process and non process based model overlap (same form)  
There are two classes of species abundance distribution models, process based models, and non-process based models.  Constraints in a process based model of species abundance distributions (SADs) provide a predicted form of a distribution, based on an assumption that the constraints that produce the form of the distribution are biologically meaningful(relevant?).  However, non-process based species abundance distribution models are purely statistical descriptions of the shape of the distribution, and do not infer any biological meaning to the constraints of the distribution.  While the goal of a process based model is to identify pattern generating mechanisms, process based models can share the same forms as other process based or non-process based species abundance distribution models.  Because of the overlap between/among models, it can be difficult to identify potential mechanisms with any degree of certainty (if two models have an identical form, it is impossible to say which model is 'correct'). The difficulty involved in distinguishing between/among models makes it challenging, if not impossible to identify a clear winner among the species abundance distribution models (citations). 

###No difference between models?  Maybe, but...
While different species abundance distribution models can share a single form of a distribution, many models have different but highly similar forms of the species abundance distribution.  Because many forms of the species abundance distribution are highly similar, some have suggested that there is effectively no difference between models (i.e., that the differences between/among models are so small that the models are functionally equivalent)(citations).  However, there has been little work done to rigorously test this assertion.   


###No comprehensive comparision across models using the most rigorous statistical approaches, large datasets (plus across taxonomic groups).
While there have been some studies that compete species abundance distribution models against one another (citations including the Ulrich one), there has not yet been a comprehensive comparison across models using the most rigorous statistical approaches, large datasets, or across multiple taxonomic groups.  


# Methods
###Data, (from White et al 2012, minus the broken Gentry site 102 or something like that).
I used the following datasets analyzed by White et al. 2012 to test the performance of five species abundance distribution models.  

####BBS
The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a publicly available dataset, etc. etc.  available <link to BBS data> (BBS;
Sauer et al. 2011). Number of sites.
####CBC
The Christmas Bird Count (CBC) is conducted by volunteers, etc. not publicly available, MOU, (CBC; National Audubon Society 2002). Number of sites.
####Gentry
The Alwyn Gentryâ€™s Forest Transect dataset (Gentry) information about Gentry data (Gentry; Phillips and
Miller 2002). Number of sites.
####FIA
The Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) information, etc. (FIA; USDA Forest Service 2010). Number of sites.
####MCDB
The Mammal Community Database (MCDB) publicly available at Ecological Archives <link> (MCDB, Thibault et al. 2011). Number of sites.
####NABA    
The North American Butterfly Count data (NABA) is conducted by volunteers, details, not publicly available, MOU, (NABA; North American Butterfly Association 2009). Number of sites.

Gentry site 102 was culled from the dataset due to a previously unidentified flaw in that site (one species had a decimal rather than integer abundance).  In total, I used data for 15,847 communities across four taxonomic groups over six large datasets.  The data have a North American bias, as the BBS, CBC, and FIA data are restricted to North America.

A small percentage of sites (number of sites) in the FIA dataset blew up on the negative binomial and the Poisson lognormal and one site in the MCDB blew up on the Poisson lognormal (Appendix?).  For sites where a model or models failed, AICc weights were calculated for only those models which successfully fit the data and blanks were inserted into the list of AICc weights post calculation.  All other model/data combinations ran successfully. 

###Likelihood based statistical comparison (White et al 2008, Edwards et al 2007, 2008)
I used a maximum likelihood approach to model fitting because it is the best (find a better word) one for this type of model comparison (citations).  If a model did not have a likelihood method for fitting the model to empirical data, it was excluded to keep the results comparable across models. 
Used AICc (citations).
I used the corrected Aikaike Information Criterion (AICc) to identify the model with the best performance for a given dataset (citation).  AICc was used because more robust, provides a penalty for more parameters (citation).  Also, seemingly magic.
The model with the greatest AICc weight was determined to be the winning model for that site.
Packages used to do analysis.
Model fitting and log-likelihood calculations were performed with the macroeco_distributions module in the macroecotools package, while AICcs and AICc weights were calculated with the macroecotools package (<https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools.git>).

I followed the recommendations for strong inference in comparing species abundance distribution models provided by McGill et al. 2007.


###Model selection (justification of why we chose those, justification for neutral theory, Neutral theory predicts the negative binomial distribution (Connolly et al. 2014.)
List of models used, packages used to implement code

McGill et al. (2007) classified models into five different families: purely statistical, branching process, population dynamics, niche partitioning, and spatial distribution of individuals .  I attempted to test models from each of the separate families, excluding the spatial distribution family (McGill et al. 2007) which requires spatially explicit data.  I had initially tried to test the generalized Yule model (branching process family), but this model proved difficult to fit to empirical data and failed to converge to a solution for many of the communities, so it was excluded from the final analyses.

This might be a place to talk about the Ulrich paper, because it seems like their power-law choice was in the branching process family, or at least it cites the same Nee 2003 paper that the McGill et al. 2007 paper uses.  Thus, connecting the not using the gen Yule to the Ulrich paper might be important here.

Ethan's paper about discrete distributions being better finds that discrete approximations are more appropriate choices for model selection that continuous version of the distribution, so all models used were discrete forms of the distributions.

I tested the following distributions with the following packages: 

Might make this into a table, like the infamous Table 2.

###Link to code.
Code neccessary to duplicate analyses and figures is available at <https://github.com/weecology/sad-comparison>. The majority of the raw data neccessary to duplicate the analyses are provided in the sad-data folder in the GitHub repository; however, the CBC datasets and NABA datasets are not publicly available and were not included.


# Results
The untruncated logseries had the best model fit in the majority of cases, for all datasets combined (Figure 1).  However, the pattern varied for each dataset individually.  For the BBS, CBC, FIA, MCDB, and NABA data, the untruncated logseries provided the best fit, while the Poisson lognormal provided the best model fit for the Gentry data, with the untruncated logseries coming in a close second (Figure 2).  The geometric performed the worst for all datasets (Figure 1), and was never the best fit for the BBS, CBC, Gentry, and NABA datasets (Figure 2).  The negative binomial distribution failed to fit a small number of sites (get actual numbers).

The actual distribution of AICc weights varied with each model.  The peaks of the AICc weights tended to overlap for the logseries, negative binomial, and Poisson lognormal (Figure 3), although the Poisson lognormal had an additional smaller peak around 1, indicating that it had very good model fit in the cases where it was the winning model (Figure 3).  The majority of the AICc weights for the geometric series were near zero (Figure 3).

# Discussion

####Different processes can generate identical models. (expansion of point from introduction)
Different process-based species abundance distribution models can generate identical forms of the species abundance distribution.  For example, the negative binomial distribution, a purely statistical model of species abundance distributions, is also the predicted result of neutral theory at the local scale (Conolly paper).  Actually, this might be a place to have that potential table with the form of the distribution on the left and a list of the mechanistic models that produce the shape of that distribution or proposed mechanisms on the right.

####Statistical difference vs. biological relevance (i.e., is there enough difference that we can distinguish between possible mechanisms)
Something about AICc weights and the number of parameters vs. the likelihoods and model fit and what that all means.  Make the point that even if one model does win, the actual difference between/among the models might not be enough to conclusively state that the processes suggested by that particular model are the dominant processes operating in the system.  

Something acknowledging model failure for certain datasets, which I suspect is due to a low species richness and abundance.  Both the negative binomial and the Poisson lognormal distributions failed to provide an accurate fit to empirical data for n number of datasets. In cases where total community abundance is low and species richness is low, those models are not a good choice.  Also maybe Ken's feasible sets?  

####Paragraph on the Ulrich et al. 2010 paper. (limitations of their approach)

####Next steps: identify if there are explanatory patterns in winning model by taxonomic group or by space. Or by species richness/abundance?
