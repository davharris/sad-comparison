#Introduction
<!--Overarching introduction that ties all three chapters together -->
Macroecology is a data-intensive approach to answering ecological questions.  

There are some criticisms of macroecology, one of which is the terrestrial focus, also lots of birds and North America
<!-- cite some of the recent critiques and directional papers -->

As the discipline has matured, a set of best practices for testing patterns and theory with macroecological techniques have been developed.

Best practices for testing macroecological theory <!--citations-->
Multiple taxonomic groups
Multiple ecosystems
Multiple patterns

I followed these best practice recommendations to expand the amount of publicly available data for underrepresented taxonomic groups.  I then combined that data with additional publicly available data to rigorously test models of the species abundance distribution.

I compiled a set of data from the literature to address some of the concerns about the lack of data for underrepresented taxonomic groups.  My primary focus for data collection was to collect data for those vertebrate taxa which are not already well represented by publicly available data.  I selected these taxa, because their taxonomy is fairly well resolved when compared to invertebrate groups.  While my primary focus was on fish, reptiles, and amphibians, I also compiled data on spiders and beetles.  In addition, I also collected a small amount of bird data, which could potentially be used in comparision with the large, publicly available bird datasets to determine if the dataset affects the results.
Data filling in gaps, data, data, data.


Questions answered with the data 
Two major focuses in ecology in general, and macroecology in particular are pattern and process.  

Here we present a unique dataset for addressing macroecological questions, and demonstrate how the data can be applied, in combination with additional data to address questions involving one of the most ubiquitious macroecological patterns, the hollow curve species abundance distribution.  While there have been numerous comparisons of species abundance distribution models, few have tested more than two models against each other.  We perform the largest test of the species abundance distribution to date, competing five models from each of four different model families: purely statistical, branching process, population dynamics, and niche partitioning [@mcgill2007].  We also build off work by Connolly et al. 2014 to determine if species abundance data is suffiencient for identifying neutral vs. non-neutral processes [@connolly2014]. <!--In chapter 1, I demonstrated something about how more data are better by competing several forms of the species abundance distribution something about can't remember, got interrupted.  In chapter 3, I used the data I compiled to additional test something about process and neutral theory.-->
