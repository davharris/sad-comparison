#Chapter 1

# Introduction
Proliferation of SAD models, no agreement about winners. (citations galore)
Statistical descriptions of SAD distributions, vs. process based.
Set up process and non process based model overlap (same form)

No difference between models?  Maybe, but...

No comprehensive comparision across models using the most rigorous statistical approaches, large datasets (plus across taxonomic groups).


# Methods
Data, (from White et al 2012, minus the broken Gentry site 102 or something like that).


Likelihood based statistical comparison (White et al 2008, Edwards et al 2007, 2008)


Model selection (justification of why we chose those, justification for neutral theory, Neutral theory predicts the negative binomial distribution (Connolly et al. 2014. Commonness and rarity in the marine biosphere. PNAS 111: 8524-8529. http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8524.abstract)

# Results
The geometric series did not do very well at all.

Assorted colorful graphs (check Post-It notes).

# Discussion

Statistical difference vs. biological relevance (i.e., is there enough difference that we can distinguish between possible mechanisms)

Different processes can generate identical models. (expansion of point from introduction)

Paragraph on the Ulrich paper. (limitations of their approach)
